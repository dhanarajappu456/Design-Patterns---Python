# .
In this pattern, an object is passed to a Successor, and depending on some kind of logic, will or
won't be passed onto another successor and processed. There can be any number of different
successors and successors can be re-processed recursively.
# . 
This process of passing objects through multiple successors is called a chain.
# .
The object that is passed between each successor does not know about which successor will
handle it. It is an independent object that may or may not be processed by a particular successor
before being passed onto the next
