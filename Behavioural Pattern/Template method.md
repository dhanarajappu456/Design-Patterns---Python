The Template Method Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure. 
It is used to create a method that provides the outline of an algorithm and allows the steps of the algorithm to be implemented by concrete subclasses.<br><br>

The key idea behind the Template Method Pattern is to define the structure of an algorithm in a method but leave some steps of the algorithm to be implemented by subclasses.
This pattern promotes code reuse and allows for variations in the implementation of certain steps without changing the overall algorithm.

<br><br>
It has Abstract class and Subclass or concrete class
The Abstract Class consist of  :<br>
1)Template method  defining the order or general outline of algo <br>
2)Hooks - These are methods with default implementation or empty implementation <br>
the sublass/concrete class can implement them leave unimplemented (and use default implemenation)<br>
3) Abstract methods - they are abstract methods - that subclass has to implement <br>
