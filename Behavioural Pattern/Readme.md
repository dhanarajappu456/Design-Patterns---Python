# Behavioral Design Patterns

Behavioral design patterns in software development address the interactions and collaborations between objects, enhancing flexibility and maintainability. This repository explores common behavioral design patterns and provides examples for better understanding.

## Categories

### 1. Chain of Responsibility Pattern

- **Intent:** Pass requests along a chain of handlers. Each handler decides whether to process the request or pass it to the next handler in the chain.
- **Use Case:** Decouple the sender and receiver of a request, enabling multiple objects to handle the request without the sender knowing the ultimate processor.

### 2. Command Pattern

- **Intent:** Encapsulate a request as an object, allowing for parameterization of clients, queuing of requests, and logging of parameters.
- **Use Case:** Parameterize objects with operations, queue requests, or support undoable operations.

### 3. Interpreter Pattern

- **Intent:** Define a grammar for interpreting sentences in a language and provide an interpreter to interpret sentences.
- **Use Case:** Interpret sentences in a language, representing them as a tree of objects for further processing.

### 4. Iterator Pattern

- **Intent:** Provide a way to access elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
- **Use Case:** Traverse elements in a collection without exposing the collection's structure.

### 5. Mediator Pattern

- **Intent:** Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Promote loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly.
- **Use Case:** Centralize communication logic between objects to reduce dependencies.

### 6. Memento Pattern

- **Intent:** Capture and externalize an object's internal state so the object can be restored to this state later.
- **Use Case:** Provide the ability to undo/redo actions and support versioning.

### 7. Observer Pattern

- **Intent:** Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
- **Use Case:** Implement distributed event handling systems.

### 8. State Pattern

- **Intent:** Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.
- **Use Case:** Represent state machines and switch between states dynamically.

### 9. Strategy Pattern

- **Intent:** Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
- **Use Case:** Select an algorithm's implementation dynamically.

### 10. Template Method Pattern

- **Intent:** Define the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but let subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.
- **Use Case:** Implement invariant parts of an algorithm in a base class and allow subclasses to customize certain steps.

### 11. Visitor Pattern

- **Intent:** Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.
- **Use Case:** Define operations that can be applied to a set of related classes without altering their structure.
