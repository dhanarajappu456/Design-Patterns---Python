builder pattern used to create complex objects at runtime, 
it is useful when u need to include only some component(attributes) in creating the final product 


builder pattern solves the telescopic problem , where u need to have multiple and huge number of constructor for a product to be overloaded based on the attribute that you would need to use to create the product


it is also useful when you need to invoke mtehods  on object in a particular order than return the object 

for example conside house object, the house object is completeed when 
we  call
a)make_plot 
b)make_wall
c)put_window, 
d)put_door
e)make_ceiling 

and so on.. 
finally house is returned

```
from abc import ABC,abstractmethod

#house is the product that is built
class House:
  
  def __init__(self):
    self.walls = 0
    self.doors = 0
    self.house_type = None
    
  def specification(self):
    print(f"{self.house_type} with spec : walls ={self.walls}, doors ={self.doors}")



#Interface for the builder
class IHosueBuilder:
  @abstractmethod
  def set_type(self):
    pass
  def set_walls(self):
    pass
  def set_doors(self):
    pass
    


#Builder has the product(house) object , which it builds
class HosueBuilder(IHosueBuilder):
  
  def __init__(self):
    self.house = House()
    
  def set_type(self,house_type):
    self.house.house_type = house_type
    return self
    
  def set_walls(self,walls):
    self.house.walls = walls
    return self
    
  def set_doors(self,doors):
    self.house.doors = doors
    return self
  def build(self):
    return self.house 
    



#director has builder object , based on different director , the same builder class is instantiated differntly, 
#which in turn create the product differntly
class IglooDirector:
  @staticmethod
  def construct():
    return HosueBuilder().set_type("Igloo").set_doors(1).set_walls(0).build()
