# Structural Design Patterns

This repository contains examples of various structural design patterns implemented in Python. Structural patterns focus on how classes and objects are composed, providing solutions to simplify system architecture and promote code reuse.

## What are Structural Design Patterns?

Structural design patterns deal with the composition of classes or objects, defining how they can be combined to form larger structures. These patterns provide solutions for creating flexible, modular, and maintainable software by organizing components in a clear and reusable manner.


Basically solving bigger problems(with bigger structure) using smaller problems(smaller structure) 

## Patterns Included

### 1. **Adapter Pattern**
- **Description:** Allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface.
- **Example:** Adapting an old API to a new one, or integrating legacy code with modern systems.

### 2. **Bridge Pattern**
- **Description:** Separates abstraction from implementation so that both can vary independently.
- **Example:** When you want to avoid a permanent binding between an abstraction and its implementation.

### 3. **Composite Pattern**
- **Description:** Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
- **Example:** Representing graphical shapes as a composite structure of simple shapes and complex shapes.

### 4. **Decorator Pattern**
- **Description:** Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
- **Example:** Adding functionalities to objects without modifying their structure.

### 5. **Facade Pattern**
- **Description:** Provides a simplified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.
- **Example:** Simplifying the interaction with a complex subsystem by providing a higher-level interface.

### 6. **Flyweight Pattern**
- **Description:** Uses sharing to support a large number of objects efficiently.
- **Example:** Managing a large number of similar objects with shared state.

### 7. **Proxy Pattern**
- **Description:** Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
- **Example:** Implementing lazy loading, access control, logging, or monitoring.

## How to Use
- Each pattern is implemented in a separate Python file within the `patterns` directory.
- Run the Python files to see the patterns in action.
- Explore the code and comments to understand the structure and implementation details.
